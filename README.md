# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

The objective of this space is to serve as main repository of my Neural Networks and Deep Learning studies.

This uses the Coursera's DeepLearning.ai specialization as knowledge source. 

This specialization has 5 courses, each one with a related repository:

- **Course 1**: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- **Course 2**: Improving Deepn Neural Networks
- **Course 3**: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- **Course 4**: Convolutional Neural Networks
- **Course 5**: Sequence Models
